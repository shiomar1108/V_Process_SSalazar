 * main-blinky.c is included when the "Blinky" build configuration is used.
 * main-full.c is included when the "Full" build configuration is used.
 *
 * main-blinky.c (this file) defines a very simple demo that creates two tasks,
 * one queue, and one timer.  It also demonstrates how Cortex-M4 interrupts can
 * interact with FreeRTOS tasks/timers.
 *
 * This simple demo project runs 'stand alone' (without the rest of the tower
 * system) on the Freedom Board or Validation Board, which is populated with a
 * S32K144 Cortex-M4 microcontroller.
 *
 * The idle hook function:
 * The idle hook function demonstrates how to query the amount of FreeRTOS heap
 * space that is remaining (see vApplicationIdleHook() defined in this file).
 *
 * The main() Function:
 * main() creates one software timer, one queue, and two tasks.  It then starts
 * the scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  prvQueueSendTask() sits in a loop that causes it to repeatedly
 * block for 200 milliseconds, before sending the value 100 to the queue that
 * was created within main().  Once the value is sent, the task loops back
 * around to block for another 200 milliseconds.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() sits in a loop that causes it to
 * repeatedly attempt to read data from the queue that was created within
 * main().  When data is received, the task checks the value of the data, and
 * if the value equals the expected 100, toggles the green LED.  The 'block
 * time' parameter passed to the queue receive function specifies that the task
 * should be held in the Blocked state indefinitely to wait for data to be
 * available on the queue.  The queue receive task will only leave the Blocked
 * state when the queue send task writes to the queue.  As the queue send task
 * writes to the queue every 200 milliseconds, the queue receive task leaves the
 * Blocked state every 200 milliseconds, and therefore toggles the blue LED
 * every 200 milliseconds.
 *
 * The LED Software Timer and the Button Interrupt:
 * The user button BTN1 is configured to generate an interrupt each time it is
 * pressed.  The interrupt service routine switches the red LED on, and
 * resets the LED software timer.  The LED timer has a 5000 millisecond (5
 * second) period, and uses a callback function that is defined to just turn the
 * LED off again.  Therefore, pressing the user button will turn the LED on, and
 * the LED will remain on until a full five seconds pass without the button
 * being pressed.
